          <p>When the leader of an artist residency kills the possum that’s been eating their cauliflower, the residents come to a shocking consensus.</p>

          <h3>THE WHY</h3>
          <p>The world is shifting and we are moving towards a more equitable culture. However, many of us have become obsessed with not being canceled, eager for the simplicity of “us vs. them” thinking. We are interested in the potential for a <strong>productive way to deal with moral ambiguity</strong> — to normalize people we label “good” acting badly and “bad” people being good.</p>
